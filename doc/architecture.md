# Architecture

In the large, Sous has been consciously designed to be as simple as possible.
It's purpose is to shepherd software projects from git repos into production on Singularity clusters.
Along the way, it makes sure that services are built into minimal docker containers.

In this document, we try to lay out the approaches we've chosen,
how we're modeling the domain,
and the overall structure of the Sous project.

Please read the [sous ontology] first, as it contains definitions for many of the words used in this document.

_N.b. while this document is written in the present tense, at the time of writing it refers more to intention than implementation.
That is, not everything described in this document exists yet._

## Components

**Sous Build** is a tool used both for local development and on build servers.
It makes use of "buildpacks" to convert source code into a production container image.
There are a number of steps involved in this process.
The key requirement, beyond producing the container image,
is labelling it with the revision of the source code from which it was derived
and registering it with the container image registry.

The **Sous Server** manages the Global Deploy Manifest (GDM).

The GDM is made up of service manifests:
small descriptions of a service, e.g. where to find its implementation and where to put the running artifact.
The overall GDM is maintained as a versioned history, so that changes can be tracked over time.

A service manifest is identified with a canonical package name that points to a location within a source code repository.
For each target deployment cluster, it contains a deployment definition, which specifies

- the particular source code revision,
- environmental configuration, and
- a _resource declaration_

for deployment to the cluster in question.

Sous Server receives proposed updates to the GDM,
validates them using a series of automated checks
and commits the new GDM as the "intended" state.

Sous Server continuously compares the GDM to the real world, represented as an **actual deployment set**, or **ADS**.
The ADS is produced by interrogating all the known Singularity clusters for their actual state.
The server then computes and issues commands to transform the ADS to match the GDM.
Once those commands have been carried out, and the ADS matches the GDM,
the new GDM is marked as "current" and "achieved"
and the previous "current" GDM version loses "current" but retains an "achieved" flag.

The server maintains a queue of GDM updates.
If there are items in the queue when a new update is received, the behavior depends on
the nature of the update
and the updates already in the queue.
If there aren't any updates in the queue for the same manifest already
(i.e. no updates that refer to the same piece of software)
the update is compared to the current ADS and deployment instructions are generated.
If there are are updates with the same service, the update is rejected _a la_ a failed HTTP conditional update.
This should only ever happen if a service team tries to make multiple deploy updates at the same time, for the same software.
This type of conflict is assumed to be rare, so the incidence of rejected deployments should be small.

**Buildpacks** are sets of instructions used to build container images from source code.
The bare minimum buildpack starts from an existing Dockerfile, builds the associated container image and labels it for use by Sous Server.
More featureful buildpacks build an intermediate container as a host to produce deployment artifacts (e.g. a JAR file, a node_modules tree)
and then transfer that artifact into a deployment container image prepared to execute the artifact.
Also possible would be support containers e.g. to be test the resulting container by doing end-to-end tests.

A buildpack should be able to evaluate a working tree containing source code and report whether it knows how to generate an artifact from that context.
Sous Build uses this facility to enumerate the candidate buildpacks for a project,
and possibly auto-select the single reporting buildpack.
If no single buildpack presents itself, the developer can select from those that do report compatibility
or inquire via the `sous` tool as to why certain buildpacks have rejected their project.

**Contracts** are simple, well structured tests of the behavior of a container, in terms of interactions with other containers.
They're analogous to unit tests, where the unit of execution is a container.
Contracts can also be seen as assertions on the state of the system as a whole.
The current challenge is to provide either/both of
 mocks or real instances for dependencies of the service;
  this includes other services and not-yet-sousified services like databases or message queues
 and
 setup/teardown of real instances of those service dependences.
In the latter case, the contracts are more properly considered integration tests.

## Deployment Descriptions

Every application deployed by Sous corresponds to a deployment description.
These descriptions are a concept internal to the Sous system;
users will usually manipulate applications or instances, which are each views over deployment descriptions.
(Deployment descriptions are sometimes referred to simply as 'deployments.')

A deployment description is a tuple which binds:
- A cluster name
- A [declaration of required resources](#resource-declaration)
- A [source ID](#source-id)
- A dictionary of environment variables
- A list of project owners
- An application kind
- The number of instances the application should be scaled to in the named cluster

Not only can a particular deployment description refer to multiple running application instances (by virtue of the instance count),
deployment descriptions can refer, for instance to intended states which haven't been realized yet.

Generally speaking, deployment descriptions have two sources:
they can be built from the deployment commands issued by users
or
they can be synthesized from data collected from the running clusters.

"Intended" deployments (that is, those built as the result of user commands)
exist in a number of states -
waiting,
current,
achieved (but no longer current),
passed over (older than current, but was never itself current).
These states are determined as the server checks the state of the running clusters and issues commands to update them.

Deployments are also frequently organized into "deployment sets".
The criteria by which a deployment set is selected from all possible deployments is used to describe the set.
The most basic sets are
the _actual_ set (all the deployments collected from running clusters),
and
the _current_ set (all the deployments that are current i.e. match the last known state of clusters).
The ADS is represented internally exactly by the actual deployment set,
and
the GDM is represented internally by the current deployment set.
Other sets include the set of deployments in a particular cluster,
or
the historical deployments of a particular service, as represented by a canonical package name.

## Version Name ##

A version name consists of a [semantic version] \(semver\) compatible source code repo tag,
paired with the revision ID that tag points to.
By itself, it does not identify anything, but is used as part of a [source ID](#source-id)

Version names are typically represented as semantic versions, where we use the revision ID as the
semver metadata. This means that any semver metadata from your source code tags is ignored,
and replaced internally by sous with the revision ID.

Versions names can be constructed from git tags, for example, for a git tag "v1.0.0" pointing at
commit SHA c4bba9e, the version name would be:

    1.0.0+c4bba9e

For git tag "1.0.0-beta.5", the version name would be:

    1.0.0-beta.5+c4bba9e

And, for git tag "0.2.33-beta.5+this.bit.is.metadata.3" the version name would be:

    1.0.0-beta.5+c4bba9e

[semantic version]: http://semver.org

## Source ID ##

A **source ID** completely identifies a specific version of a piece of software.

Within sous, a source ID serves as as a pointer to everything that represents that version of the software,
like the source code, resultant docker images, a set of running instances etc.

A source ID consists of a [source location] paired with a [version name].

Typically, a source ID can be written as a triple, in the format `<repo>,<version name>[,<path>]` e.g.

    github.com/opentable/sous,1.0.0,src

[version name]: #version-name
[source location]: #source-location

### Source Location

A **source location** refers to the location of source code describing a piece of software,
but is not bound to a particular version of that software.

As a data structure, source location is a repository URL paired with a directory offset within that repository.
The directory offset is necessary since some repositories describe multiple pieces of software
which must be differentiated.

Source locations are useful in particular contexts,
	such in the manifests, which contain version information adjacent, allowing full deployments to be constructed.

Example source locations:

    github.com/opentable/sous
	github.com/opentable/sous,server

### Checking Versions

The use of a tag plus a revision ID provides redundant information.
Where a [source ID](#source-id) is being used in an interactive context,
	and the version number no longer matches the recorded revision ID
		(i.e. the git tag has been moved)
	an error should be reported and the operation should be rejected.
However, where name is being used in a context where no human is present,
	the revision ID (e.g. the git SHA) should be used, and considered correct,
	but if the corresponding version tag has been moved,
	the user should be notified.

### String Representations

While source IDs are triples of values, they must sometimes be represented and manipulated as strings.
Specifically, at the interfaces of Sous, both with human beings and other software.

The default string representation of an entity name begins with a character not matching `[A-Za-z0-9]`
and which doesn't appear any of the three parts of the name.
This character will be used as the delimiter for the representation.

The rest of the representation is straightforward -
concatenate the source URL,
the delimiter,
the version identifier,
the delimiter,
and then the path.

For example:
`^example.com/project^v1.0.0-rc+132984adf^my-app`

When ',' is a legitimate choice as the delimiter, it should be preferred, and it may be omitted from the first position in the string.
If the first character in an entity name string is alphabetic, the delimiter should be taken to be ','.

Using the default delimiter rule:
`git://example.com/project.git,v1.0.0-rc+132984adf,src`

### Opaque Representations

In some contexts, the components of an entity name may not be acceptable.
For instance, Docker image names treat '/', ':' and '+' specially.

For these uses, the opaque representation exists.
To produce an opaque representation, begin by
choosing any string, excepting that it cannot contain 'sous' as a substring.
 (the string should be chosen to suggest to a human the entity's identity,
 and in order to disambiguate the resulting string for e.g. tab completion.)
Concatenate the string with 'sous',
	generating the usual string representation.
	Base64 encode the representation.
	Concatenate the encoded representation.

In general, opaque representations should be useful as exactly that, but note that the original entity name can be recovered from them if needed.
